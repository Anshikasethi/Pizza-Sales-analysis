# Pizza-Sales-analysis
This analysis report delves into the sales performance of a pizza business, providing key insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior. SQL was utilized for data preprocessing, cleaning, and structuring the dataset to prepare it for in-depth analysis. Once the data was refined, Power BI was used to create an interactive dashboard, enabling users to explore various dimensions of the sales data with ease.
